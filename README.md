# Lachat-Formatter
Creates a file that can be imported into the Lachat's (QuickChem 8500) control software so the user no longer has to type in the samples by hand into the control software. Previously the user would have to hand enter all sample identification numbers and correctly input the required sequence of standard checks for the analysis to be valid. This software ensures I.D. numbers are not incorrectly input and that the standard checks occur at their proper time.

The software takes an input file that is generated from the sample database and outputs a file that the Lachat software can import.
